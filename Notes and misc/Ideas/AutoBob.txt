Drop of Paint
	location of canvas
	square of 3x3 pixels centered at location
	center of drop has high alpha; otuter pixels lower alpha
		center alpha between 0.4 and 0.6
		edges 0.05 to 0.07
		corners 0.01 to 0.03

PAINTING ACTION
	PE dragged on a line (deposites drops of paint at each pixel along the line)
		stroke is a set of paint drops through the line segment
	stabbed on the canvas (desposites drop of paint)
	Final color to put on canvas depends on:
		color of paint on PE
		original color on canvas and
		alpah value assigned to the pixel
	alpha blending
		b = as + (1-a)d
		b final color
		s color of paint on the PE
		d color on the canvas
		a transparency of PE; 0 transparent, 1 opaque
	Each time a drop is deposited PE's amount decreases
		by a random value between 0.09 and 0.11

Painting Entities
	amount of paint  0-100
	color of paint	rgb; 0-255; or 'undefined' for dry with no paint 
	dry brush is used to blend colors on canvas
	amount = 0; dry brush
	States:
		(start) wet with loaded paint; amount > 0
			switches to drying from laoded paint when amount reaches 0
		drying from laoded paint; amount just became 0
			blending switches from we blending to dry blending by 0.01 for each
			drop of paint. switched to dry with canvas paint when blending reaches
			dry blending.
		dry with canvas paint; amount = 0, but picked paint from canvas
			adquired color of fix pixel on canvas it is dragged over.
			used to belnd colors in the canvas
		(Start) dry with no paint; amount = 0; hasn't touched the canvas
			picks color a swtches to dry with canvas paint first time it touches the canvas.
	Blending Equation
		n = bc + (1-b)o
		n = paint color on PE
		o = original PE color before blending
		c = color on canvas
		b = blending control value between 0 and 1
			0.001 to .03 for wet blending (0.03 for low paint aoumtns 0.001 for high paint amounts)
			0.2 to 0.95 for dry blending (0.95 if low pressure, 0.2 if high pressure)
	blending amount is randomly ajudted by the bush for each PE, by percentage -3 to 3
	3D effect
		color adjustment = p * (a-80) / 20
		p; random persentage between -10 and 10
		a; amount of paint in PE

Brush
	PEs: { PE, position relatve to brush center}

	loading of paint; (color, amount) load each PE with random adjustment of -5 to 5%
